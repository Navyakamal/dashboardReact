This project provides a structured approach to managing dashboard-related functionalities in a React application.

Features:

Dashboard Service:
1.Handles dashboard operations like fetching and processing data.
2.Data Fetching: Retrieves data from a local JSON file using modern asynchronous methods like fetch.

JSON Data Source:
1.Fetches and processes data stored in a JSON file (/assets/dashboard/data.json), allowing for easy updates and local testing.

Modular Design:
1.Each service is separated into its own file, making the code organized and scalable.
2.New services can be added easily without affecting existing ones.

Modern JavaScript:
1.Uses ES6+ syntax (import/export) for clean and readable code.
